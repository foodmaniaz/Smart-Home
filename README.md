# Smart-Home
In this project, Arduino is used for controlling whole the process. Here we have used GSM wireless communication for controlling home appliances. We send some commands like “F1ON*”, “F2OFF*” and so on for controlling AC home appliances. After receiving given commands by Arduino through GSM, Arduino send signal to relays, to switch ON or OFF  the home appliances using a relay driver.
